# Project-3
Blockchain Technology w/ Test Driven Development 

## Objective 
To challenge my understanding of Test-driven development, BlockChain creation, and Objected Oriented Programming. To Test-Driven Development Skills, I used the Jest library offered by JavaScript to test each line of code prior to running my instances. For my Blockchain creation, I used the concepts taught in the Blockchain Module of the course in order to write my pseudocode. Finally, to pick up on how to use Javascript, I used my psuedocode to research what syntax was required and how they varied from python. 

## Getting Set-Up 

### System Dependencies 
* NodeJS 
* NPM 

### Steps
1. Create a directory where you want your project ot be stored (mkdir) 
2. Convert that directory to a a NodeJS Project (cd into project director --> NPM init -y) 
3. Install Jest and mark it as a library dependency that will be used in the development of this project. (npm i jest@23.6.0 --save-dev)
4. In the package.json file, change the value of the "test" key to: "jest --watchAll" 
5. Run npm run test 

## Object Oriented Programming 
### File System 
Package JSON: The package.json file contains information regarding the NODEJS project, but it can always be editted. 

Config.js: The config.js file contains all hard coded value such as the Genesis block. 

block.js: Consists of the block class and it's methods

.test.js: ANy file with the .test.js extension is 

## Test-Driven Development 
Test driven development is the approach to programming where you test all code prior to deploying it to production. First, you write tests

### Jest 
Jest is a Javascript library that runs test on JavaScript code; and in this project, we will be using it to make sure that our block-chain logic is working properly.
